# 🚀 WATI Webhook Service

A beginner-friendly WhatsApp messaging service built with FastAPI and WATI API. Perfect for those learning Python web development!

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Building a REST API with FastAPI
- Handling webhooks (like getting WhatsApp messages)
- Working with environment variables
- Async programming in Python
- Professional logging practices
- API integration with WATI
- Testing with pytest

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:
- Python 3.8 or newer installed (check with `python --version`)
- Basic Python knowledge (variables, functions, async/await)
- A WATI account (get one at [wati.io](https://wati.io))
- Your favorite code editor (VS Code recommended!)

## 📚 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wati-webhook-service.git
cd wati-webhook-service

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
WATI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
WATI_ENDPOINT=https://your-instance.wati.io
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
```

### 3. Run the Service

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Your service will be running at `http://localhost:8000`

### 4. Test the Webhook
